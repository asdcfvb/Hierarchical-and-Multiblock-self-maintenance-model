>
> > Our code is released at [[**Code link**]](https://github.com/asdcfvb/Hierarchical-and-Multiblock-self-maintenance-model/tree/main)
>
> You can check the structure framework by looking at `model.py` .
>
> If you want to see the details and settings of the code running, you can try to reproduce it by running `HMASCRAE_phase.py` in the `experiment` file.
>
> At the same time, we will place the offline trained model parameters `scaler_params_final. py` and `semi_Supervised_HMASCRAE.final. py`  in the `save_model.py` file for you to quickly reproduce the results in the paper in `HMASCRAE.online. py` without the need for retraining.
